# 🌍 SODIC – Semantic & Open Data Innovation Chemnitz

**SODIC** is a research group at TU Chemnitz focused on advancing open and semantic data infrastructures.  
We explore how structured, interoperable and spatially linked data can foster innovation, transparency, and collaboration across public administration, science, and civil society.
